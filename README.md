## General info
At the beginning, this is an assignment of ITU Signal And System Course to handle signal manipulations.

*The Discrete Signal Normalization and Convolution
 Discrete signals that have high dimensions and needed the resolution and 
is the best practice to learn how to analyze understanding fundementals about Signal and Systems. 
In this code is about the evaluation of the discrete signals. 
Importing these libraries is necessary are in the following;

`import numpy as np`
`import sys`
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`


## Development Environment
This Project is written on PyCharm 2018 version with Windows 10 Operating Sytstem.
Also, This application is tested  on Windows Powershell accurately.
