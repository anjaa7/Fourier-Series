# Welcome to the my System and Signals repository!

This repository contains the code and resources related to an assignment on the topics such as Fourier series, image convolution, and audio signal processing.

## What is included in this repository?

This repository includes:

  * Python code used to perform Fourier series analysis, image convolution, and audio signal processing tasks
  * Example images and audio files used as inputs for the image convolution and audio signal processing
  * Impulse responses used in the audio signal processing tasks
  * Plots and graphs generated by the code, showing the results of the Fourier analysis and image/audio processing
  * A report detailing the methods and findings of the analysis ( In Serbian language )

## What is Fourier series?
Fourier series is a mathematical tool used to represent periodic functions as the sum of a series of sine and cosine functions. It is often used in the field of signal processing to analyze and manipulate periodic signals, such as audio or image data. This repository contains code related to the calculation and visualization of the amplitude and phase spectra of periodic functions using the Fourier series.

The amplitude spectrum of a periodic function is a representation of the amplitudes of the individual frequency components that make up the function. It is typically plotted as a function of frequency, with the amplitude of each frequency component represented by a point on the plot.

The phase spectrum of a periodic function is a representation of the phases of the individual frequency components that make up the function. It is also typically plotted as a function of frequency, with the phase of each frequency component represented by a point on the plot.

## What is image convolution?
Image convolution is a mathematical operation that takes an image as input and produces a modified version of the image as output. It is often used to apply specific image processing filters or effects, such as blurring or sharpening.

## What is audio signal processing?
Audio signal processing is the field of study concerned with the manipulation and analysis of audio signals. It involves techniques such as filtering, equalization, and compression, which are used to enhance or modify the characteristics of audio signals.


## What is impulse response?
In the context of audio signal processing, an impulse response is a measure of the response of a system to a brief input signal, often referred to as an "impulse." It can be used to characterize the frequency response of a system, such as a room or a piece of audio equipment, and can be used in convolution to apply the characteristics of the system to an audio signal.
