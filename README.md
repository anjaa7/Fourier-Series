# Welcome to the my System and Signals repository!

This repository contains the code and resources related to an assignment on the topics such as Fourier series, image convolution, and audio signal processing.

## What is included in this repository?

This repository includes:

  * Python code used to perform Fourier series analysis, image convolution, and audio signal processing tasks
  * Example images and audio files used as inputs for the image convolution and audio signal processing
  * Plots and graphs generated by the code, showing the results of the Fourier analysis and image/audio processing
  * A report detailing the methods and findings of the analysis ( In Serbian language )

## What is Fourier series?
Fourier series is a mathematical tool used to represent periodic functions as the sum of a series of sine and cosine functions. It is often used in the field of signal processing to analyze and manipulate periodic signals, such as audio or image data.

## What is image convolution?
Image convolution is a mathematical operation that takes an image as input and produces a modified version of the image as output. It is often used to apply specific image processing filters or effects, such as blurring or sharpening.

## What is audio signal processing?
Audio signal processing is the field of study concerned with the manipulation and analysis of audio signals. It involves techniques such as filtering, equalization, and compression, which are used to enhance or modify the characteristics of audio signals.

## How can I use this repository?
You can use this repository as a reference for how to apply Fourier series analysis, image convolution, and audio signal processing techniques using Python. The code and report included in the repository provide a detailed explanation of the steps taken and the results obtained.

You can also use the example images and audio files provided in the repository to experiment with different image convolution filters and audio processing techniques and see the effects on the images and audio.

I hope this repository is helpful to you! Thank you for visiting!
